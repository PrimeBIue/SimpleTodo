## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

It was hard to get the hang of how positioning objects in the design window works, I had to experiment a bit to get it right by playing with the code of the .xml. And definitevely the hardest part to understand was the RecyclerView, the implementation of the ItemsAdapter class was a bit confusing to me and led me to get some code errors, but I was able to disect them using the debug tool and fix them.
